00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,990
<i>We have just entered May.
- Yes.</i>

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,050
<i>May reminds you of the past,
there's even 'May Disease',</i>

11
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,530
<i>and people stop going to
school or something.</i>

12
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,100
<i>They sometimes can't keep up with
the new material in their classes.</i>

13
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,900
<i>And before, something
like Biology...</i>

14
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,790
<i>I took that, I hated it!
- Right?</i>

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,930
<i>You hated it? I seemed to not like it.
- Yes.</i>

16
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,850
<i>The illustrations?
- Yeah, the illustrations.</i>

17
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,960
<i>And unfortunately,
I got this postcard.</i>

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,100
<i>Alright, here's a biology
problem, okay?</i>

19
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,771
<i>What is an animal with no teeth
in the mammal species?</i>

20
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,370
<i>Everyone says stuff like anteaters,
but the answer is an old lady.</i>

21
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,091
<i>What about an old man?
- Old men are included as well.</i>

22
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,300
<i>Alright, shall we move on
to the last topic? - Yes.</i>

23
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,450
<i>This is from Nakayama, in Yokama.
- Alright, Nakayama.</i>

24
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,670
He knows an old man,
but when all of the

25
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,850
old man's friends are dying
one after the other,

26
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,020
he's the only one staying alive,
and he's asking why.

27
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,620
<i>I don't know.
- Well.</i>

28
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,900
Here's the answer.
With all of those funerals,

29
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:34,420
and carrying the casket all of the time,
his legs and back became strong.

30
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,560
<i>He became a strong guy.</i>

31
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,680
<i>This one, the ending
is is a hit, isn't it? - Yeah.</i>

32
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,250
Nakayama, you're doing
a great job!

33
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,280
<i>Should we give him something?</i>

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,450
<i>That's a good idea.
- Maybe a sweatshirt.</i>

35
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,680
<i>Alright, let's give him that.
- Give it for free.</i>

36
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,620
You did amazing.

37
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,050
Funerals these days are
hard without money.

38
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:47,450
Right.

39
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:51,450
Once you get picky about caskets too,
there are even ones with sprinklers.

40
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,080
Stop it!

41
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,650
Once the temperature reaches a certain point,
the sprinkler turns on automatically.

42
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,700
That way the body won't
feel too hot.

43
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,220
That's great, isn't it?

44
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,220
Alright, now it's time to
say goodbye.

45
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:00,850
Okay!
- Yoshi and...

46
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,114
...Yuuko's...
- ...Midnight Disk!

47
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,050
Hiroshi and Yuuko, great job
today, thank you.

48
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,080
Great job.

49
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:11,250
Do you think they're dating?

50
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,850
They do it so often.
- That's just them being comfortable.

51
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:18,119
He has a kid from his divorced
wife, doesn't he?

52
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:35,770
<b>Joke With a Sorrowful Heart</b>

53
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,250
Great work!

54
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,100
I told you we didn't need the car,
'cause we're going drinking.

55
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,050
What are you going to do tomorrow morning?
The PTA meeting at Ken's school.

56
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,190
Why don't you go?
You know the school better.

57
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:54,560
No, tomorrow's the Parent-Kid
chorus day!

58
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,620
The parent needs to go!

59
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,740
Mr. Hiroshi!

60
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:14,050
You don't ever dance, do you?

61
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:16,300
How could I dance while drunk?

62
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:19,020
Then, why do you even go
to a disco?

63
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,020
Can you let me stay at
your place?

64
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,222
You're always sleeping over.
- Not in that way.

65
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,420
You're serious?

66
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,850
Nope!

67
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:32,020
Stop it!

68
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,990
<i>Mr. Hiroshi!</i>

69
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,570
What great timing!
Mr. Itou!

70
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,500
He's the next manager of the department.
- Nice to meet you.

71
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,450
It is also a summer thing,
won't you pop in for me?

72
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,250
Fuji honey, hurry up and introduce me!
- Hm? Oh yeah.

73
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,020
She's the hostess of the
"L'amour Club".

74
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,620
Nice to meet you!
I own a hostess club,

75
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,420
come to mine sometime too,
won't you?

76
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,960
That's a good idea, let's go!
- I'm a big fan!

77
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,620
Want to go?

78
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,530
No.

79
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,650
Alright.
- Okay, let's go.

80
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:19,792
Okay, okay, okay, don't ring it so
much in the middle of the night!

81
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,910
Who is it?

82
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,080
<i>It's me.</i>

83
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,480
Okay, okay, I got it already.

84
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,220
Don't ring it so much!

85
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,540
Ouch.
- Ah, I'm sorry.

86
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,530
You push it open, huh?

87
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,990
Come on!

88
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:43,900
I thoroughly spent time with
them. Thoroughly.

89
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:46,510
Are you okay?
- Thoroughly using me...

90
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,280
What are you saying?
- I'm lonely, so.

91
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,330
Ow, okay, just...

92
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,680
Just let me sleep.

93
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,970
Come on, this isn't helpful.

94
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:01,080
I wasn't thinking that someone's
coming over at this hour.

95
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,160
People think that we have a
relationship even when...

96
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,220
Where are you touching?
- Ouch!

97
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,880
People think we have a relationship
even when we don't.

98
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,650
My head...
- I don't like complicated relationships!

99
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,182
My head and hand hurt,
my hand hurts.

100
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,140
Come on!

101
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,190
Is that the trash?

102
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:39,310
Want me to?
- It's fine.

103
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:42,820
The glass goes over there.
- I know!

104
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,140
That goes over there.

105
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,530
You're gonna drink coffee, right?

106
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,480
Uh-uh.

107
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,570
Last night was long.

108
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,900
They took me to two, three places so
early in the morning. I'm exhausted.

109
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,170
No one's listening.

110
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,390
Dad, you can't wear my pajamas.

111
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:24,731
This is yours, huh? No wonder
it's so small. I'll wash it, okay?

112
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,450
My, oh my.

113
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,250
This is really bitter.
- Cutting back on sugar.

114
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,300
Sweet things are bad for you.

115
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,631
Talking like you're so important.

116
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:41,100
Today's that, uh, PTA
Parent-Kid chorus, right?

117
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,820
It's fine, you don't have to come.
- I should go, right?

118
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,940
You don't have to come.

119
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,530
Here's Japanese...

120
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,620
Social studies, social studies,
social studies...

121
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:54,650
Hey!

122
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,420
You're buying stuff like this
and reading it?

123
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,940
You bought that the other
day, Dad.

124
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,740
Alright, I'm going, bye!

125
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,480
Hey, Ken.
What's the matter?

126
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:14,800
Dizziness.
It happens sometimes recently.

127
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:17,310
It's because you're out late.

128
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,620
I'm not like you, Dad.

129
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,820
Clean up when you're done, okay?
Just put it in the sink.

130
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,140
I'll do the rest.

131
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,420
Bye!

132
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,310
Here you go.

133
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:55,480
Wow, you're wearing a necktie?

134
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,500
I have to straighten up for
things like this.

135
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,390
I know that.

136
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:02,050
Oh, you have rehearsal from 1 o'clock,
so please leave here by 12.

137
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,420
You're dressed too flashy, stay back,
don't follow so closely.

138
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,710
Oh, it's starting to rain!
Here, an umbrella.

139
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,330
Why bring such a flashy umbrella?

140
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,730
<i>One fifth plus three fifths is...?</i>

141
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,050
<i>Four fifths!</i>

142
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:21,450
If the denominators are the same,
you add just the numerators.

143
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,220
<i>Today, we reviewed fractions.</i>

144
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:30,140
<i>Next, let's finish up with the Parent-Kid
chorus that we promised.</i>

145
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,820
<i>Today,</i>

146
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,620
Mr. Hiroshi whom we know
from TV is here.

147
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,590
No, I mean, Igarashi's
father is here,

148
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,420
so let's try our best today!

149
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,740
The conductor is Igarashi.

150
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,620
Isn't it great that your
dad is here?

151
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,330
<i>Alright, let's move the desks.</i>

152
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,880
Hurry, hurry!

153
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,420
Would the mothers please move
toward this side of the room?

154
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,820
Thank you.

155
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,160
You can't sing, right? That's why
I said you didn't need to come.

156
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,790
Zenpei was nagging me to come,
that's why I came.

157
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,190
What is this?
You're going to conduct up there, right?

158
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:14,310
Dad is going to sing, okay?

159
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,650
<i>Alright, then!</i>

160
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,880
Is everyone ready?

161
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,360
Ah, sir, please, join us.

162
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,370
Please, join us.
- Over here, Igarashi's father.

163
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,370
Okay!

164
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
One day, I...

165
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:49,300
<i>One day, I talked deeply
with my dad.</i>

166
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,050
Green, oh...!

167
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:57,740
<i>About the joys of living in this world,
and about the sadness.</i>

168
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,820
There, oh... sing, blue...

169
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,730
<i>Green, green,
the birds sing in the blue sky.</i>

170
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,560
Green, green!

171
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:13,000
<i>Green, green, the green la la la stretches
to the other side of the hill.</i>

172
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:21,170
<i>At that moment, my father said,
while holding me in his arms.</i>

173
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,420
Ah...!

174
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:28,360
<i>Don't cry even when la la la
you're sad or dark.</i>

175
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,100
One morning...

176
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:37,170
<i>Green, green, a soft wind blows
through the blue sky.</i>

177
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,450
<i>One day, I...
- Green, green,</i>

178
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:45,540
<i>the green increases la la la
over the hill.</i>

179
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:53,680
<i>One morning, I woke up
and then found out.</i>

180
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,250
<i>That in this world there are hard
and sad times.</i>

181
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:01,330
What are you doing, just mouthing the words
like a gorilla with artificial teeth!

182
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,650
How can I sing a song like this? I'm going
to get hives from a Parent-Kid chorus.

183
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,370
Wait, Mr. Hiroshi!
- Watch Ken.

184
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:27,220
The promise I made with my
dad that day... I think...

185
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:34,200
I had my fist up to one of my eyes,
and stood my ground.

186
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:39,170
Green, green, tears were
on my eyelids...

187
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,160
Hi.

188
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,280
You were watching, huh?

189
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
You fool!

190
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Hello.

191
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,650
Sleep deprivation and dizziness?
- Yes.

192
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:07,450
Ken?

193
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,220
Maybe he's tired from the
Parent-Kid chorus?

194
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:13,300
I don't know what it is, but the nurse from
school said a doctor should look at him.

195
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,480
She's worried because he
gets dizzy often.

196
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,530
Then take him to the doctor.
- We went right away.

197
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:21,190
We had a hospital introduced to us,
and they examined his brain,

198
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:24,300
and the doctor said he has to talk to
the parents, and to come right away.

199
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,420
Really?
- Yes!

200
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Let's go, then.
- Okay.

201
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,110
Brain Stem Tumor.

202
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,625
This is the cause of his dizziness.

203
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,280
<i>Is it dangerous?</i>

204
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Well.

205
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:42,450
Progressive Intracranial Pressure. Meaning,
that the brain is under a lot of pressure.

206
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,500
So what happens now?

207
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,480
Sadly, that's it.

208
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,300
Comparatively speaking, patients seem
to suffer less and sleep more.

209
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,050
Does that mean he's
going to die?

210
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:03,600
Doctor, don't be so calm,
please do the surgery.

211
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,480
Surgery of the brain
stem is difficult.

212
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,850
It's hard to insert a
scalpel or a laser in there.

213
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,325
If you damage the important part
of the brain, it's instant death.

214
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:23,540
Well, doctor, can't you do something?
Please.

215
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,777
I'll give you the films and a letter, so
you'd better go look elsewhere.

216
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,330
<i>Production in Session</i>

217
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,360
Ah, boss!

218
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,250
What is it?
Is Hiroshi being unreasonable?

219
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,880
I don't know, he just told me to
call you, it seemed serious.

220
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,850
Really?

221
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:47,020
That's terrifying, well,
how is he?

222
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,160
He was very worked up.

223
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,280
Okay!

224
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,790
<i>It's okay! Hiroshi!</i>

225
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,480
<i>Hey, hey!
- It's done!</i>

226
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,500
What are you doing?
- What's the matter, Mr. Hiroshi?

227
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,420
It's done, Mr. Hiroshi!

228
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,190
Stop it, Hiroshi!

229
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,990
Wait, Mr. Hiroshi!
- Mr. Hiroshi!

230
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,990
<i>Mr. Hiroshi, stop, stop.</i>

231
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:06,710
Everyone, help!
Mr. Hiroshi!

232
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,560
What are you doing?

233
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,880
Mr. Hiroshi! Mr. Hiroshi! Mr. Hiroshi!
- Stop it!

234
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,620
Stop it!

235
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,620
Stop!
- Mr. Hiroshi!

236
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:17,157
What are you doing?
What did you want to talk about?

237
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,680
What's going on, you punk?!

238
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,130
Woah, are you okay?

239
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,420
Find me a doctor,
one of yours.

240
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,790
Can you find me one that
will actually help?

241
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,900
Also, I need money.
Give me 1,000,000 yen.

242
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:34,100
And I can't be working
all the time.

243
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,790
Just work within the city, and
nothing late into the night.

244
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:39,190
What does this mean, Mr. Hiroshi?
- Hey, you listen.

245
00:15:39,310 --> 00:15:41,740
Calm down and explain!

246
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:46,530
There's the advance... we got an advance
for at least six month's worth.

247
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,280
What do you mean doctor?

248
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,960
A doctor for the head.
A brain surgeon.

249
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,390
A brain surgeon?

250
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,710
Mr. Hiroshi, is this about Ken?

251
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,140
Don't say it so loudly.

252
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,820
Apparently...
- Yeah?

253
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,420
Apparently, it's a brain tumor.

254
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,488
What?
- You can die if you don't do anything.

255
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,360
And...
- Yeah.

256
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
The surgery is difficult.

257
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:12,140
You're kidding, right?
That can't be true.

258
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,080
That doctor's joking around!

259
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,447
We'll look thoroughly, alright?

260
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,590
I'm counting on you.
- Yeah!

261
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:23,510
Also, we can't tell Ken
about this.

262
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,280
So don't tell anyone, okay?

263
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,100
Okay.
- Acting, okay?

264
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,620
Do some acting.

265
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,570
You're such a radish,
so do it properly!

266
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,300
Hey, Rokusuke.
- Huh?

267
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:38,038
You couldn't act and became the
manager, so try harder.

268
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,250
What's up with you?

269
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,790
It'll be alright!

270
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,910
Ken will be fine!

271
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,500
I know that you need help.
I'll look everywhere!

272
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,620
That's right!
- Yeah!

273
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,028
There's gotta be a doctor that
can do it, even if it's difficult.

274
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,990
There's gotta be one.
- That's right!

275
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,730
Right?
- Yeah!

276
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,760
There is one!

277
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
There will be one.

278
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,480
Good luck!

279
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,945
What does he need the
luck for? Huh?

280
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,160
Doctor, can't you stop glaring
at that and research more?

281
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:48,740
You have CT scans and so many
more things, don't you? I'll pay.

282
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:53,130
We can't apply radioactive waves too much,
it's dangerous to stimulate the tumor.

283
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,730
This picture is enough.

284
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,850
This is really great.

285
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,387
I mean, these aren't post cards so,
what's the deal?

286
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,765
It's just like this diagnosis says.

287
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:09,555
If it goes on like this,
in the near future...

288
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:12,165
What do you mean in
the near future?

289
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,100
Well, there are many cases.

290
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,020
I don't mean the normal case,
I'm talking about my son.

291
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,820
Is it dangerous in the next
two or three days?

292
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,500
No, not the next two
or three days.

293
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,620
Then, one month?

294
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,770
Two months?

295
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:33,370
What about three months?

296
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,330
There is the possibility
that the condition

297
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:40,160
won't progress, but will
maintain its current state.

298
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:44,910
He needs to take the medication, and
reduce salt intake and stress.

299
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,438
I can't say that he'll get better, but
we'll try to maintain his condition.

300
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:53,755
Won't he get better?
I need him to get better!

301
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,020
Please, do the surgery.

302
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:00,420
I can't do it.
It's in a bad place.

303
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:04,400
I can't see it working,
I can't do it.

304
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,140
Then, what should I do?

305
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,280
Help him maintain a healthy life.

306
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,650
And try to use the time left,

307
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,650
to give him the best life possible.

308
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:23,110
Doctor...

309
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,130
My son is ten.

310
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,680
Ten years old.
How can I say to my ten year old son,

311
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,450
that he needs to live his best life
because he's going to die?

312
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:36,730
That's common sense. You, as the parent,
need to stay silent and endure it.

313
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:39,160
Don't lose hope until the end.

314
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,680
Give your boy a fulfilling life.

315
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,250
I'll find a solution.

316
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,940
Don't lose hope.

317
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,050
<i>Hey, daddy.
- Huh?</i>

318
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,170
Am I sick?

319
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:08,650
Oh, your dizziness, when
we examined it,

320
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,540
they said that nothing's wrong.
Right?

321
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,850
Yeah!
Don't worry, don't think about it.

322
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,510
Don't stay up late, okay?
It's bad for you.

323
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,530
It's boring being at the
house by myself.

324
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:24,050
Dad said that he'll be home
earlier from now on.

325
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,370
And don't eat salty foods.

326
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,560
And no oily foods either.

327
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:32,650
If I'm alone, I eat too much
when I cook food,

328
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:35,390
and the flavor is too much
when it's instant food.

329
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:39,530
From now on, Dad will try to eat
with you as much as possible.

330
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,650
Right?
- Huh?

331
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,110
<i>Right?</i>

332
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,229
What's the matter?
You're acting strangely, Zen.

333
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,480
No, I'm not.

334
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,420
You'll find a doctor soon?
- Yes!

335
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,360
What is this?

336
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
The boss and I are looking.

337
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:08,700
If you don't hurry,
it won't be in time!

338
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,990
We'll be trying our best,
so you do too!

339
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:15,390
Be like a dad.
- Then, give me less work.

340
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,700
I can't have family conversations.

341
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,190
<i>Great job.</i>

342
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,220
I heard your singing,
it's great.

343
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,420
You're a really great guy
when you sing.

344
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:29,400
I'm always a great guy.
- You're playing with me again.

345
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,880
Oh, by the way, can you help me
with shopping?

346
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,330
I need to get something for Ken, but
I don't understand children's things.

347
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,820
I don't know either.
- You're still a kid here.

348
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,940
You're touching again!

349
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,740
Here, candy.

350
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,626
You were holding it,
that's disgusting.

351
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:55,570
Ken! Ken!

352
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,250
We bought some great stuff!

353
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,600
Here.

354
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,280
It's Guldo's LD!
And Rample!

355
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,620
Wow!
This is amazing!

356
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:10,760
Here you go!
- A Laser Disc?

357
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,620
Wow! Why?

358
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,050
Right?
It's so surprising! Why?

359
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:19,250
What do you mean? It's normal for parents
to buy things for their kids.

360
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:22,100
It's so sudden, though!
That's weird.

361
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,498
This kind of thing is...,
you know?

362
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,850
Why do you two keep
talking to me?

363
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,717
Why don't you talk directly
to each other?

364
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,730
You two are embarrassed!
What a weird family.

365
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,390
What are you saying?

366
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:39,450
Oh, we need to eat!
I'll make supper.

367
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,570
What? Can you cook?

368
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,089
I used to do it all the time
before I sold well.

369
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,820
How about we have a
light tasting meal?

370
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,190
Maybe some stewed vegetables
and a meat tofu dish?

371
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,100
And, uh, seaweed soup!
That kind of stuff.

372
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,050
We don't have vegetables. There isn't
any tofu, seaweed, or vinegar either.

373
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,050
Really?

374
00:24:57,170 --> 00:25:00,420
We'll get it if we go to the supermarket,
the ones that are open until morning.

375
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,480
Oh my, there really
isn't anything.

376
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,530
I have some curry made.

377
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,650
Curry?

378
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,590
Wow, it smells good.
You made this, Ken?

379
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:11,020
Yes!

380
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:13,300
Let's eat this, come on,
get some plates.

381
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,600
You like curry too, right?
- Yes.

382
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,540
Lots of salt here.

383
00:25:32,050 --> 00:25:34,710
Oh, good morning!
- Good morning.

384
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,850
Good morning!

385
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,420
Good morning!

386
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,280
Huh?

387
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,600
What are you doing?

388
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,560
You'd know if you looked.

389
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,560
So many eggs everywhere! I can make
an omelet for you if you want!

390
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,850
It's fine, I'm doing it!

391
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,620
It's okay, I'll do it, let go.
- I said I'll do it.

392
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,740
I'll do it, okay?
- What?

393
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,330
Ouch! You idiot!
- Huh?

394
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:05,527
<i>Are you alright?
- You're noisy!</i>

395
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:09,324
What are you shouting about
in the morning?

396
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,560
Woah, this is awful.

397
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,330
Isn't it bad?
Right?

398
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:17,590
Mr. Hiroshi, Ken and I will do the rest,
so you can sit over there, okay?

399
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:20,000
Please, we'll take care of it.

400
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:24,100
Not too much salt, alright?
And add a salad.

401
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,530
And not coffee, but milk.

402
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,450
Let's do a soft boiled egg
if we need to avoid salt.

403
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:30,570
Okay, how about the salad?

404
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,820
Do we have any?

405
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,022
We don't have vegetables.
- You have an orange!

406
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,820
Alright, I'll do the toast
and eggs,

407
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,160
so can you do the plates,
milk, and orange?

408
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,530
Got it! I'll do it once I wash
my face and change.

409
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:44,530
Alrighty!

410
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:46,650
Hurry okay? Right away!
- Yup!

411
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,130
Ouch!

412
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,530
You dare to.
- What is it?

413
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:58,500
Don't be so friendly with
Ken, you moron.

414
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,220
Trying to stop the bond between
parent and child?

415
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,530
I'm sorry, I got carried away.

416
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,530
Then, let's switch places.

417
00:27:04,650 --> 00:27:05,820
Okay?
- Okay.

418
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,730
The toast will toast itself,

419
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,620
so just cook the eggs
for four minutes.

420
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,820
We have milk...
Ouch!

421
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,020
Then, I have nothing to do.

422
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,760
Ken!

423
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,450
<i>I'll step out, so do it
with your dad, okay?</i>

424
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,570
What? With Dad?

425
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:25,930
Interaction with your parents.
A beautiful thing to get along, right?

426
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:28,140
What's up with both of you?

427
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:31,120
Everything's strange,
yesterday and today.

428
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,650
Ouch!
- What are you doing, you idiot?

429
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,250
You radish!
Incompatible!

430
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:34,880
Incompatible...

431
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,530
'A beautiful thing to get along'?

432
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:41,050
You are not acting for an add!
Everyone will suspect!

433
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:42,730
But you're being suspicious too!

434
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,650
How come I'm being suspicious?
- You are.

435
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,760
<i>What do you mean?
- Why are you arguing?</i>

436
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,880
Did you do the toast correctly?
- It should be done any minute.

437
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Ah! Ouch!
- Oh no!

438
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,820
Hiroshi!

439
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,390
Cut!

440
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:17,788
Sorry, can you do it
one more time?

441
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,790
One more cut.
- It's the seventh time.

442
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,850
Film change.
- I'm sorry.

443
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:23,450
Alright!
- You're doing great.

444
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,570
Rest for a minute, okay?

445
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,220
It's so cute!
It looks great on you!

446
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,510
Can I get a signature?
- Me too!

447
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,280
Alright, no, no, step aside.

448
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,420
Move back!
- Okay, okay.

449
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,684
Okay, later, alright?
- Let's go.

450
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,147
We found a doctor who
will do the surgery.

451
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,910
Oh, Mr. Igarashi?

452
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,360
Hello, thank you for earlier.

453
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,020
This is Doctor Hayaguchi, he's the one
that's going to do the surgery for you.

454
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,360
Let's do it, if it's for you,
Mr. Hiroshi Igarashi.

455
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,000
My son is a fan of yours.

456
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:12,680
Um, I heard that the surgery
is in a difficult spot.

457
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,620
Yes, I've looked at the
diagnosis and film.

458
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:18,300
Let's try it.

459
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,430
I've prepared for the surgery.

460
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:23,447
I took the X-Ray, just in case.

461
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,620
This is the only place
that said they'll do it.

462
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,930
They said it needed to be done right away,
so they've made the preparations already.

463
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,450
<i>This is great, isn't it?
- You can come over here!</i>

464
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,480
Yes.

465
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,680
Over here, please.
- Please.

466
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,620
Please, officially stamp
your name here.

467
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,910
You could use your thumb too.

468
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,160
It's a written consent for
me to handle things.

469
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,990
It might look intimidating.
But it's just paperwork.

470
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:56,710
I don't want any problems
later on.

471
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,930
Do you mean that you're going to fail?
- Well.

472
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,280
Surgeries aren't full-proof.

473
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,680
In Ken's case, if you fail
he dies, right?

474
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,500
I'm saying, that I'll focus on trying
instead of succeeding.

475
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,650
What's the percentage
of success?

476
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:16,740
Well, this is a very difficult surgery,
so the percentage,

477
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,020
it's more of a gamble.

478
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,370
A gamble?

479
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,420
That's irresponsible,
calling it a gamble.

480
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,540
Irresponsible?

481
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,910
Mind your language!

482
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,680
Trust in each day's possibilities
and do the surgery.

483
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,480
What part of this motto
is irresponsible?

484
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,930
Every other hospital
let you down.

485
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:43,199
Your kid is a patient that is
100% going to die.

486
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:50,050
Oh!
- Hey, Hiroshi.

487
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:56,930
Let's go home.

488
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,620
It's not over yet.
- We don't need to do this crap.

489
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,050
But the doctor...

490
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:02,560
That isn't a doctor.

491
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,880
You are not sick.

492
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,880
How about we eat
something good, huh?

493
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,020
Something's strange.

494
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,940
What is?
- Going to so many doctors.

495
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,100
Well, that's because I'm worried about
your dizziness. But it's nothing.

496
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:39,910
Today's doctor was disrespectful,
so we got in a fight.

497
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,450
You weirdly want to
stay at home,

498
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,518
and you're strangely clinging
to me recently.

499
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:52,540
I mean, as a father, I want to
sometimes do fatherly things.

500
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,700
This is a great chance, is there
something that you want?

501
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,310
Or something you want
me to do? Huh?

502
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:02,400
Well then, can you let me
be alone tonight?

503
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:06,770
It feels so crowded,
I'm used to being alone.

504
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,110
My shoulders start to hurt.

505
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,220
Why don't you go out tonight?

506
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:14,650
Bye!

507
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,650
I'm sorry, Mr. Hiroshi,
for being late.

508
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,450
I couldn't find a parking spot.

509
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:27,121
Oh! The boss is waiting at the
sushi place over there.

510
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,420
Huh?

511
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,540
Where's Ken?

512
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,680
He said to let him have
some alone time.

513
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,280
Huh?

514
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,611
He says it's too crowded with us.

515
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,620
What should I do?
Huh?

516
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,480
What can I do?

517
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:49,710
I can't help his disease,

518
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:55,000
and I can't be kind to him even
if I want to. What can I do?

519
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,500
But boss,

520
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:40,450
why do you think Hiroshi Igarashi
is suddenly so serious?

521
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,790
He stopped going out, and decreased
his amount of work.

522
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,480
Maybe he's trying to get into
an art academy?

523
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,450
What are you saying, teacher?
Art academies,

524
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:51,620
are things you try to get into when you
have no appetite and no sexual appeal.

525
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,470
His name sounds great,
'Awfully Bland'.

526
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,740
Wow, you're really mean!

527
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,510
Hey Kaoru!
This is no laughing matter, listen,

528
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,480
becoming serious when
you're young,

529
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,280
just leads you to failure in your
job or sickness. Huh?

530
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:15,790
Although that shouldn't happen.

531
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:19,680
We want him to do great,
don't we?

532
00:34:25,910 --> 00:34:29,310
Oh hey!
Long time no see!

533
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,020
That hurts.
- Did you hear?

534
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:33,140
You laughed.
- Gahyon!

535
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,027
It's fine.
- I don't have that many jokes.

536
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
He doesn't understand people.

537
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,200
Gahyon!

538
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,484
What an idiot, yelling,
"Gahyon!"

539
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,590
It's been a while, hasn't it?
Since we last drunk.

540
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,710
Can I get a beer?
- Yes.

541
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:56,970
How's being a father?

542
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,850
It's apparent that a guy can't
support a kid alone.

543
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:05,680
Do families normally have a
housewife or a mother?

544
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,850
Should I be the mother,
the housewife, for you?

545
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,680
Don't joke, we're not playing house.

546
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,887
<i>If you came, it'd be like having
an extra kid. - Here you are.</i>

547
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,080
What is it?

548
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:47,170
<i>Ken!</i>

549
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:51,957
What are you doing out here?
Is something happening?

550
00:35:52,310 --> 00:35:55,160
I'm just killing time before
cram school starts.

551
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,990
You go to cram school?
- I've been going since fourth grade!

552
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,990
Really?

553
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,420
Were you that stupid that you
needed to go there?

554
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:07,080
I'm just tagging along, everyone
goes to cram school.

555
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,050
I don't want to be left out.

556
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,790
Are they not including
you in baseball?

557
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:16,910
I'm not good at it.

558
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,650
<i>Go, Yousuke!
- You can do it, Yousuke!</i>

559
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,080
<i>What are you doing, third?</i>

560
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,880
Thanks, mister!
- Sorry about that!

561
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,790
Let me in, come on.

562
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,910
Ken!

563
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,760
<i>Thanks!
- Hey, I want to be the pinch hitter.</i>

564
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:41,790
What? You're going to be
the pinch hitter? - It's fine! Here.

565
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:44,850
Wait a minute.
You're Hiroshi Igarashi!

566
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,740
Hiroshi!
- Hiroshi!

567
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,570
Hiroshi!
- Hiroshi!

568
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,850
Hey, guys, go to your
positions, positions.

569
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,500
Get off, it's not time to
be climbing on me.

570
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,050
Wait!
- Wait for it!

571
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,050
I've been to the nationals before.

572
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,500
Are you ready?
Alright.

573
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,310
Let's go! Wait,
- Go, go, Mr. Hiroshi!

574
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,220
Let's do this.
- The bat's the opposite way.

575
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,880
You mean like this?
I can't hit it like this, you idiot.

576
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,990
What's wrong with it?
- No, no, like this!

577
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:18,250
Okay. The nationals were
a long time ago.

578
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,820
Let's go!

579
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:20,850
Here we go!

580
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:23,130
Get a home run!
- That's a foul!

581
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:24,160
<i>Here we go!</i>

582
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,420
<i>Do your best!
- Do your best!</i>

583
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:32,280
What's the matter?
- My back...

584
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,280
I just hurt it, ouch.

585
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,130
In a pinch, I become the
pinch hitter.

586
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,450
Hey, that's not fair.

587
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:43,340
It's not unfair, it's fine!
Hey, hey, Ken!

588
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:49,770
No! Igarashi can't play,
he's bad at it.

589
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,760
You idiot, this is his dad.

590
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,740
It's fine, whatever, go play defense.

591
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:58,680
Go on, hurry up!

592
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:08,370
I'll be the umpire.

593
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:09,360
Alright, nice.

594
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,620
Throw a good one!
- Go, go, Ken!

595
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:16,540
Foul ball!
Throw a good one!

596
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,450
Ouch, ouch! Foul ball!
- What?

597
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,570
It's true!

598
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,020
What have you been doing?

599
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,280
I was letting Ken play baseball.

600
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,680
What are you doing?
- Yuuko is here.

601
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,050
She says that she's going to
be the housewife.

602
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,170
Huh?

603
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,050
Ah, welcome home.

604
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:48,020
I can't tell where things are at all!

605
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:50,620
Once you're done, you need to
clean the bathroom.

606
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,157
I should go shopping first.
Dad, give me some money.

607
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,900
Dad?
This isn't playing house.

608
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,500
Oh? I'm being serious.

609
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:02,190
About playing the good family's good wife,
good mom, and good housewife.

610
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,360
I'll be completely serious.

611
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,590
Ah, you can treat my stay here
as board and lodgings. Here!

612
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:09,880
Don't touch the stuff on the table,
I'm going to take care of that later!

613
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,450
Bye!
- Mr. Hiroshi.

614
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,570
What are you going to do?

615
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,610
She'll get tired of it in three days,

616
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,745
there's no way
a woman like her can do chores.

617
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,189
It's suffocating with just
Ken and me,

618
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,620
so it'll be a good distraction.

619
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,250
I wonder if Ken will be okay.

620
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:30,480
She comes over often, so no need to worry.
- I'm talking about his sickness.

621
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,450
If Yuuko finds out...
- It's fine.

622
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,570
She'll go home soon.

623
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,500
This here, you'd better clean it.

624
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:39,620
Yes.

625
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,850
Here you go.

626
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:49,970
Thank you.

627
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,930
You have everything?
- Yup!

628
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:13,050
Bye!
- See you later!

629
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,450
Something wrong?

630
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:19,620
It's nothing.

631
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,660
Are you alright?
- Yes.

632
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,730
Hey!

633
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,850
Good morning!
- Good morning!

634
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,250
Bye!
- See you!

635
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,685
Oh dear, I haven't made breakfast yet.
You get up early.

636
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,370
I wasn't sleeping.
I was reading.

637
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:54,238
You haven't been getting much sleep
recently, have you?

638
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,683
I'm acting out because I'm
not working or playing.

639
00:40:58,110 --> 00:41:00,050
I get depressed just standing.

640
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:02,540
You're so serious this month.

641
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:05,760
You even played baseball
with Ken's friends.

642
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,190
Ken says that his friends are asking for
signatures, or wanting to be on TV.

643
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:14,330
Last night he was laughing that
he's pretty popular recently.

644
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:17,190
He's always at home, and
his personality's dark,

645
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:19,680
so it makes me want to help him.

646
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,910
Ken knows that.
He was curious, though.

647
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:25,700
No sugar!

648
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,190
I wonder why.

649
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:31,310
He said, "I wonder why he's
acting like a dad recently."

650
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,700
I wonder too.

651
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,480
It's weird. You don't have as much
work, and don't play around.

652
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,600
Did something happen?

653
00:41:41,310 --> 00:41:45,263
You're acting weird too, suddenly
wanting to be a housewife.

654
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:48,530
Are you okay with that?
It's going to be a month.

655
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:51,970
I just wanted to, in the spur
of the moment.

656
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:00,020
Well, actually, I don't
have any talents.

657
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:05,190
Singing, or acting, or talking.

658
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:07,310
I can do it a little bit.

659
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:11,280
But none of them really click.

660
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,140
I feel like a fake.

661
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:20,050
But if I do things inside
the house,

662
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,710
I calm down.

663
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,740
Won't you like me as
a housewife?

664
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:33,170
Did I fail the entrance exam?

665
00:42:34,310 --> 00:42:35,250
That's good.

666
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:37,715
You have the skills for
a housewife.

667
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:40,310
Just the skills?

668
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:44,170
I'm grateful, really.

669
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,080
Ah, it fell off.

670
00:42:58,310 --> 00:43:00,310
<i>Good morning!
- Oh!</i>

671
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:02,770
<i>Oh, you're already awake?</i>

672
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,400
<i>You're here early too.</i>

673
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:09,130
Isn't it your day off?

674
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,850
The boss wants to eat
lunch with us today.

675
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:15,450
That's unusual. Do you want to
eat lunch with us too, Yuuko?

676
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:18,650
More importantly, you don't have much
money in your bank account.

677
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:20,981
What's going on with
that, Zenpei?

678
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:24,590
I bought a dryer, the payment is
due at the end of this month.

679
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:28,529
Maybe that's what the lunch is about,
to talk about money.

680
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:34,450
Here we go, Ken! I'll make the mark
for where you should look.

681
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:38,456
Mr. Hiroshi too! Look here!
Ready, cheese! - Ready? Cheese!

682
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,510
Nice faces!

683
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:42,790
Okay!

684
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:45,850
It's almost summer break,
isn't it, Ken?

685
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:49,856
The pool here is great! It's cheap.
Take him here sometime.

686
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,968
We're going overseas in the summer.
- Really?

687
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:55,770
Amazing!

688
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,620
Hey, I have to talk to you.

689
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:04,100
Ken, let's go take some
pictures in the yard!

690
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:04,990
Yes!
- Right?

691
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,080
Ken, let's go.

692
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,416
Oh dear, you spilled so much
on your shirt, here.

693
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:15,020
Huh?
She's acting great as a mom.

694
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,620
It's already been a month,
isn't it?

695
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:19,650
I don't know what to do.

696
00:44:19,770 --> 00:44:22,280
Why don't you let her help,
asking more time?

697
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,050
I can't do something so selfish.

698
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:29,820
I mean, if you turn her play into
reality, that's all solved.

699
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,100
Oh, sorry.

700
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,220
Excuse me.

701
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:37,800
I'll find a good time
to ask her to stop.

702
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,080
I need money.
My bank account is empty.

703
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:45,910
That's what I needed to
talk to you about.

704
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:49,420
I don't have money either.

705
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,620
I'm not joking about going
overseas, you know?

706
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:58,200
If I can't find a good doctor here,
I'm going overseas.

707
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,510
I need money, give me some.

708
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:05,480
I already got an advance
for all that I could.

709
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:08,680
I don't have any more to give.

710
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:14,400
You had to cut off your job
with a lousy reason.

711
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,480
So, we can't get more of
an advance.

712
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,080
Our family is holding up because
of you, and we're friends.

713
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,470
I'd like to help you in some way,

714
00:45:23,590 --> 00:45:26,890
but I have to save the rest
for other celebrities.

715
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,200
I'm sorry.

716
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,540
I understand.

717
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,480
I'll do something about
the house and car.

718
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,050
Wait, don't go yet, I'm not
done talking with you.

719
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:40,280
Just sit down, okay?

720
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,900
There are actually two things
that would help with money.

721
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:47,380
The first is,
selling the rights to the stage.

722
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:50,448
Yoshinawa Company wants
to buy it for a year.

723
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,960
That's selling ourselves,
our act will be messed up.

724
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:55,190
Another is, Touyou Television.

725
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:57,250
You can be the announcer
for a 2-hour program.

726
00:45:57,370 --> 00:46:01,020
This is the contract for it,
read it.

727
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:06,755
What is this, "Gather All the Little Ones"?
It's a show for brats.

728
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,850
"Let's All Sing Songs
of the World"?

729
00:46:08,970 --> 00:46:09,390
Well...

730
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,330
You want me to be the
nice singing guy?

731
00:46:11,450 --> 00:46:14,330
This thing isn't something
to make fun of.

732
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:18,650
You know that big manufacture company
for kids' stuff called, Wonderland?

733
00:46:18,770 --> 00:46:23,560
It's that!
The head there is a fan of yours!

734
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,450
He has three programs during
the Golden Hours.

735
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:26,900
That's right!

736
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,130
So what?

737
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:30,790
This will help us with
our advance.

738
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:34,590
If this goes well, they want to use
you as their company mascot.

739
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,360
That's a contract of at least
10,000,000 yen.

740
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:40,300
That program is basically the national platform
for the country's parent-kid choruses.

741
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,710
They said Ken's group
could go too.

742
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,940
You could save it in video,
Ken's conducting.

743
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,352
One, two, three, four, five!
One, two, three, four, five!

744
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:59,110
Yeah!

745
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,680
Hello, everyone!
I'm enjoying this very much today,

746
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:12,620
but I don't know why I'm dressed like this.
In this world,

747
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:14,850
you would do anything for
money, but today,

748
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,420
"Let's All Sing Songs
of the World"!

749
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:18,540
So that's what we're...

750
00:48:19,570 --> 00:48:22,100
Oh dear, I'm pulling jokes
as if it's on purpose.

751
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:23,930
But what are we doing today?
Ms. Imai?

752
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:24,930
Yes.
- Yes.

753
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:29,280
Hello! Today, kids from all around the
country are singing with their mothers!

754
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,160
They're singing, huh?

755
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,190
Yes.
- Alright, I'll stop.

756
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:35,050
Alright, well I'll introduce
the first group.

757
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:38,530
Representing Hokkaido, this is the parent-kid
chorus of Fukazawa Elementary School!

758
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:39,220
What is the song?

759
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:42,250
The song is, "Oh, Blue Day".
Let's hear it!

760
00:48:51,510 --> 00:48:53,880
Alright everyone,
please be quiet!

761
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,930
Thank you for waiting so long.

762
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:59,220
Would the Kagoshima group
please head this way?

763
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,340
Alright everyone, this way!

764
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:04,450
<i>Everyone in the Kagoshima
group, this way!</i>

765
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:06,570
<i>This way!</i>

766
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:10,386
I'm sorry, could I borrow your brush?
- Go ahead.

767
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:14,480
Ah! It's finally started.

768
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:28,080
Are you ready?

769
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:29,900
They said it is about time!

770
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:32,960
They're running so late.
- The sun's going to set.

771
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,190
You should get dinner ready.

772
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:36,650
What?
- What?

773
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:38,590
Tell them to hurry up.

774
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:40,710
Alright, I'll go tell them.

775
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,590
Want me to go buy a Coke
or something?

776
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:54,710
I don't want to drink it.

777
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,220
Great job!
You all did amazing, good work.

778
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:34,650
How much did you practice?
- One week.

779
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,930
One week?
It's possible to sing this well in one week?

780
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:40,130
You surprise me! Well, you all did great.
You can go rest down there.

781
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,250
Thank you very much!

782
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:43,960
Next is...
- Yes?

783
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,020
The representative of the south,
Kagoshima in Kyushu.

784
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:49,130
Nishiyama Elementary School will be
presenting us with an amazing chorus.

785
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:51,250
<i>Cut! Cut!
- Cut?</i>

786
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,020
We need to change costumes.

787
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,820
Change costumes? It's fine,
I can wear this. - No, it's not okay.

788
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,700
Mr. Hiroshi, you'll get
the skunk.

789
00:50:57,820 --> 00:51:00,500
Kaoru, you'll get the tiger.
Please, hurry.

790
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:02,620
A skunk and a tiger?

791
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,480
Let's go home!

792
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,700
Why do I need to dress
like this?

793
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:10,960
It's a misconception to think that kids
will like it if you dress like this.

794
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,140
No sense of style, at all.

795
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:17,170
Hey! It's a success!
- I'm so thirsty.

796
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,220
I'll get it for you!

797
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:21,080
Hey, hey, hey! Be careful.
- I'm so sorry.

798
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,790
I'm sorry, are you okay?

799
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:24,620
You idiot.
- Hiroshi.

800
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:28,280
The theme for the new program is decided!
And so is the commercial!

801
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,160
The head is here, watching.
He's in a good mood.

802
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,760
He likes you!

803
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,940
Tea, tea, tea, tea.
- Here's the tea.

804
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:40,525
I can't drink it like this.
- I'm sorry, here.

805
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,300
Hey.

806
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:48,190
Is it not time for Ken's group yet?
It's already three.

807
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:50,220
They're the one after the next,
after the next.

808
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:52,590
He's so tired after
waiting so long.

809
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:55,680
Well, uh, let's have them
switch up the order,

810
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,790
and have them go first.
Go talk to the producer.

811
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,850
Huh?
- I got it!

812
00:52:00,970 --> 00:52:04,530
Then, when that's done,
I'll bring the head over.

813
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:05,280
See you!

814
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,880
So, the next group, right?
- Yup!

815
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,221
That kid was dizzy about a week ago
too, before going to school.

816
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,930
Maybe I should have
him rest at home.

817
00:52:14,050 --> 00:52:18,539
You can't do that. What is a chorus
going to do without a conductor?

818
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:22,250
The next is, the representative
from Tokyo.

819
00:52:22,370 --> 00:52:27,160
Here is the parent-kid chorus from West Adabo
Elementary School's grade 5, class 2.

820
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,080
The conductor is the son of
the announcer Hiroshi, Ken.

821
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:35,488
Mr. Hiroshi will be participating in
the chorus as well. Welcome!

822
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:00,820
Are you okay?
You can conduct? Okay.

823
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,800
I'm sorry.

824
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:26,050
<i>One day, I talked deeply
with my dad.</i>

825
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:33,680
<i>About the joys of living in this world,
and about the sadness.</i>

826
00:53:35,020 --> 00:53:40,170
Ah, he's mouthing the words again.
He's such a lame dad.

827
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,170
I wonder if he's okay,
trying so hard.

828
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:44,280
Huh?

829
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,620
Well, remember how Ken
didn't look so well earlier?

830
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:56,080
<i>At that moment, my father said,
while holding me in his arms.</i>

831
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:03,940
<i>Don't cry even when la la la
you're sad or dark.</i>

832
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:10,970
<i>Green, green, a soft wind blows
through the blue sky.</i>

833
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,850
This is a song about a
father and son, isn't it?

834
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:17,370
It is indeed.

835
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:26,340
<i>One day, I woke up
and then found out.</i>

836
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:33,680
<i>That in this world, there are
hard and sad times.</i>

837
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:41,740
<i>Green, green, clouds run
along the blue sky.</i>

838
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:49,200
<i>Green, green, the green la la la
touches the sky over the hill.</i>

839
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:18,416
Thank you so much.
Until here is fine, thank you!

840
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:20,960
I'm fine.

841
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:21,960
Here.

842
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:24,960
Yuuko is calling a taxi right now,
so let's go to the hospital.

843
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,050
You know the doctor, from
Hair something clinic?

844
00:55:28,170 --> 00:55:29,760
That's the most trustworthy place.

845
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:31,560
I've already told Yuuko.

846
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:34,330
I'm fine, I was just a little dizzy.

847
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:37,280
Just in case, alright?

848
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:40,420
Mr. Hiroshi!

849
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:43,160
We can't have you running
off like that so suddenly.

850
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,900
My kid's sick.

851
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:47,298
Go back, dad.
It's your job, right?

852
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:49,790
Please...
- The Taxi's here!

853
00:55:49,910 --> 00:55:54,198
Come on, Ken. It's written on here,
Yuuko, we'll leave it to you.

854
00:55:54,340 --> 00:55:56,620
Alright, got it.
I'll take him, then.

855
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,960
Thank you!

856
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,730
Mr. Hiroshi, you need to
change quickly.

857
00:56:00,850 --> 00:56:02,650
Yuuko will take care
of the rest.

858
00:56:02,770 --> 00:56:06,450
Please, we need you to hurry, there's a
time where the kids need to go back.

859
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:08,560
We have no time to waste.
- I got it.

860
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:10,680
You're so annoying.

861
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,450
<i>Hey, you're an employee
here, right?</i>

862
00:56:16,570 --> 00:56:17,480
<i>Huh?</i>

863
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,820
We're the representatives from Kagoshima,
but why was our time moved?

864
00:56:20,940 --> 00:56:23,850
I'm sorry, there were some
circumstances...  - We know!

865
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:27,450
The announcer's son was
in the last group, right?

866
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,050
Oh. You're here.

867
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:32,900
<i>To be honest, he wasn't
feeling well.</i>

868
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,880
Oh? Our child has a cold, and
they're doing it even then.

869
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,590
That's all the same!

870
00:56:37,710 --> 00:56:40,370
I'm sorry.
- It's all messed up, really.

871
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,390
We're gathered here since early morning,
and lunch isn't even provided.

872
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:45,880
Why are you whining?
You idiot?

873
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,420
There are some things in this world
that can't be solved with bickering.

874
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:49,160
Mr. Hiroshi!

875
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,680
What are you talking about,
"early in the morning"?

876
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,100
You were happy to be here
an hour or two early!

877
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,330
If you have time to complain,
go fix your face!

878
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,620
Mr. Hiroshi!
- Look at your face!

879
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:00,820
Your face is the one
being impolite.

880
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:02,390
Let's go!
- I'm sorry!

881
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:04,960
If you want to go home, go to Kagoshima
or wherever the heck you want!

882
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:06,880
I'm not choosing to
dress like this!

883
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,280
Mr. Hiroshi!
- Not much money, and the funny items!

884
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:10,590
Moron!
Who would like this of job?

885
00:57:10,710 --> 00:57:12,710
We're really sorry!

886
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:15,130
Hello.

887
00:57:15,250 --> 00:57:17,020
How do you do?

888
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:21,600
Could you go see Ken?
I'll do the rest alone.

889
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:25,140
You're so stupid!

890
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,200
Oh, sir, sir!

891
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:45,000
He's fine!
I mean, fine is weird, but,

892
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:50,170
nothing big is going on, meaning,
that his condition hasn't changed.

893
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:54,510
It's just, Yuuko found out.

894
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:04,370
I did use the CT scan
just in case.

895
00:58:04,910 --> 00:58:08,100
It's hard to say that it's the
same as last time.

896
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:10,220
It's still the same.

897
00:58:10,770 --> 00:58:15,170
It's not getting better,
but nothing is fatal either.

898
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:20,600
Just little by little.
Little by little, right?

899
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,600
I'm very sorry.

900
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:31,020
That can't be.

901
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:38,000
Have the boy do what he likes.
It is almost summer break, after all.

902
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:50,710
It's Dad.

903
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:54,500
Hey, they said you're fine.

904
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:58,506
They said nothing's wrong, just dizziness.
You can go home.

905
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:02,530
Really?
Isn't that great, Ken?

906
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:05,050
Let's go home then,
I don't like hospitals.

907
00:59:05,170 --> 00:59:08,400
Nobody likes hospitals,
let's go home.

908
00:59:08,850 --> 00:59:10,850
Here we go!
Good!

909
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:18,560
I'm so hungry.

910
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,560
Should I make something?
- I like that!

911
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,280
There's a chicken basket, a little bit
of salad, and I think an orange.

912
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,730
How about an omelet?
- Yeah!

913
00:59:25,850 --> 00:59:28,597
You're going to eat too,
right, Dad? Okay!

914
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:30,880
<i>Should I make some toast?
- Yes.</i>

915
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:33,000
<i>Oh, I found something.
- Huh?</i>

916
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,280
Oh! I'll get it.

917
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:40,250
<i>Yes?
- It's me, it's me.</i>

918
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:42,420
It's the boss!

919
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:48,220
I am in trouble!
I've been with them until now!

920
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,200
Everything's over.

921
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:57,050
All that talk of commercials and being
the announcer, all nothing!

922
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:02,220
Oh, hey, Ken! It's great that
nothing serious happened.

923
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:05,489
Hey. Hey.
- Oh, are you going to eat dinner now?

924
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:11,140
Ken, make sure not to
burn the toast.

925
01:00:11,370 --> 01:00:13,370
Oh, where's the butter?

926
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:20,170
You're unlucky.
The head saw your worst side.

927
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,880
I got irritated because
Ken was dizzy.

928
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:26,450
I understand, but that was bad.

929
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:32,340
That mother just happened to
be the head's favorite.

930
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:36,587
If apologizing is going
to fix things, I'll do that.

931
01:00:37,570 --> 01:00:39,680
There's just one way.

932
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:44,080
Hold a press conference about Ken, reveal
his disease and cry your eyes out!

933
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,416
If you do that, everything
will be solved, right?

934
01:00:47,710 --> 01:00:51,790
You'll have your job back just like before,
and your popularity will increase.

935
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:55,310
And then, sponsors will
start looking for you!

936
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,230
On top of that,
there will be lots of people

937
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:00,790
suggesting doctors,
or offering to treat Ken.

938
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:03,250
That may save Ken's life.

939
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:06,000
Right?
For Ken's sake!

940
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:09,820
Go home.

941
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:12,730
What do you mean, go home?

942
01:01:12,850 --> 01:01:16,401
If you leave it like this, you and
Ken will be doomed!

943
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:20,760
Go home, you idiot!
Go home now!

944
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,420
Wait a bit.
Hey!

945
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:24,620
Hey, I'm trying my best too!

946
01:01:24,850 --> 01:01:27,220
How can I do that while
my kid is dying?

947
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:29,500
What other way is there?
- Go home!

948
01:01:29,620 --> 01:01:32,880
You sure it's okay to say that to me?
Your job and money will be doomed.

949
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,050
Shut up!

950
01:01:34,170 --> 01:01:35,360
How are you going to get by?

951
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,730
You're going to need money!
- Alright, alright!

952
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:39,250
Hey, Hiroshi!

953
01:01:39,370 --> 01:01:41,480
Hiroshi!
- Don't come out!

954
01:01:50,080 --> 01:01:52,080
That music is annoying.

955
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:56,570
It's because you're shouting.
You can't let Ken hear.

956
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:59,450
Zenpei put Ken in his room.

957
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:05,400
Hey, can you step out
for a moment?

958
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,110
I must have looked stupid.

959
01:02:33,770 --> 01:02:36,850
I was all excited to play
good house.

960
01:02:37,570 --> 01:02:40,900
I'm sorry, I couldn't tell you
about his sickness.

961
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:43,020
That's out of your control.

962
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,910
I'm embarrassed of my own heart.

963
01:02:46,450 --> 01:02:48,420
I'm thankful.

964
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:51,220
Did you think I was really
going to come?

965
01:02:52,080 --> 01:02:53,220
No.

966
01:02:53,340 --> 01:02:56,450
You probably didn't think that it
would last a month, did you?

967
01:02:56,570 --> 01:02:58,130
Not really.

968
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,650
Do you understand how I feel?

969
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:06,770
Answer honestly, okay?
Or else, it'll just hurt me more.

970
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:11,930
Did you use my feelings?

971
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:14,880
That's not it.
Absolutely not.

972
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,298
It was hard for me, because I
understood your feelings.

973
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:24,820
Hey, can you answer
another question?

974
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:28,420
Are my feelings bothersome?

975
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:34,420
I like you.

976
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:42,370
But, our ages are so different, and
you're serious while I'm not.

977
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:49,340
I feel that our worlds are so different.
- Then, why did you refuse me?

978
01:03:49,850 --> 01:03:54,110
You refused me the other day, even
when I expressed my feelings.

979
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,050
Let's dance.

980
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,894
Talking like this isn't something to do
while sitting down, across from each other.

981
01:04:14,080 --> 01:04:17,080
Don't you feel bad for the girl?

982
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:21,680
Can you at least take me
seriously sometimes?

983
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:24,400
Talk seriously.

984
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:30,740
Please.

985
01:04:40,510 --> 01:04:45,480
My ex-wife said the same thing,
when she was leaving.

986
01:04:48,110 --> 01:04:50,490
Like, when I'm on TV
or on stage, when I'm

987
01:04:50,610 --> 01:04:53,190
enjoying things I'm
serious about that, right?

988
01:04:53,310 --> 01:04:55,588
I mean, I can't unless
I'm into it.

989
01:04:55,740 --> 01:05:01,280
What I'm saying is, you know how there's
a way to do light things seriously?

990
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:05,310
But when you go home,
everything becomes serious.

991
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:11,450
I just don't seem to know how to
do serious things, seriously.

992
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:17,420
So I get tired, and stop going home,
and stay out late.

993
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:20,280
And I play with women.

994
01:05:21,370 --> 01:05:25,040
And my ex-wife said that I'm
a different person outside

995
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:29,390
of the house than when I'm in.
Just all depends.

996
01:05:32,110 --> 01:05:37,604
I didn't know what to do, and I told her,
"Why don't you try having an affair too?"

997
01:05:37,940 --> 01:05:40,850
Then she got mad and left.

998
01:05:41,340 --> 01:05:47,080
It might be that Ken's head being messed up
is a sign for me to repent.

999
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,299
I can't do anything about it,
it's going to stay the same.

1000
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,600
I think that maybe,

1001
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:03,020
I am the type of person,

1002
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:06,050
that shouldn't get married
or have kids.

1003
01:06:07,910 --> 01:06:10,590
A person can seriously
do trivial things,

1004
01:06:10,770 --> 01:06:15,340
but to seriously do important things?
I don't know how to.

1005
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:19,200
It probably can't be fixed.

1006
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:29,910
<i>One day, I talked deeply
with my dad.</i>

1007
01:06:31,370 --> 01:06:39,370
<i>About the joys of living in this world,
and about the sadness.</i>

1008
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:43,493
I guess it doesn't always
work that way.

1009
01:06:45,420 --> 01:06:50,940
Hey, can you at least have your wife
come back for just this month?

1010
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:56,650
She's in Sydney right now.

1011
01:06:57,170 --> 01:07:01,056
I think she has a boyfriend there,
I can't ask her to come.

1012
01:07:24,420 --> 01:07:29,420
I'll go home now, I'm too embarrassed
to stay at your house.

1013
01:07:29,540 --> 01:07:32,300
If something happens, call me,
I'll come right away.

1014
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:34,420
Oh, right.

1015
01:07:35,510 --> 01:07:40,160
This has about 1,000,000 yen
in it, so use it.

1016
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:43,450
The pass code is 1234.

1017
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:46,450
It's fine, I have money.

1018
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:49,510
Don't lie, you only have
your house and car.

1019
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:54,050
Save your money for emergency
house fees and hospital fees.

1020
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:57,020
Use this for your
summer vacation.

1021
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,220
It's my apology for my
flippant manner.

1022
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:02,450
It's me that's flippant.

1023
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:13,220
No luck with the line of love,

1024
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:16,080
or with the line of fate.

1025
01:08:16,910 --> 01:08:18,910
You're the same as me.

1026
01:09:24,110 --> 01:09:27,200
<i>You're lonesome, isn't it so?</i>

1027
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:38,710
Why do you look so lonely?
Huh?

1028
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:44,910
I guess drinking this late
should be lonely.

1029
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:50,620
But everything is okay as long as I
have this. The night keeps ongoing.

1030
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,300
Would you like a sip?

1031
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:56,650
Hey, drink. You can have it.
Drink it.

1032
01:09:57,970 --> 01:09:59,970
Night and friend.

1033
01:10:10,970 --> 01:10:15,080
Hey, come to my house,

1034
01:10:16,110 --> 01:10:19,400
and let's drink it together.
Okay?

1035
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:55,480
That’s you, right?
Mr. Hiroshi Igarashi.

1036
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:12,769
I guess you have figured out
what this is about.

1037
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:15,529
I don't have to explain
further, then.

1038
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:18,910
I won't demand a high price.

1039
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:23,510
5 million. Okay?
Then you can have this.

1040
01:11:26,140 --> 01:11:27,790
I have no money!

1041
01:11:27,910 --> 01:11:32,480
Listen, I only have my house and car.
You understand? I have no money at all.

1042
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:33,760
That kind of trick doesn't...
- Hey!

1043
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:34,700
I found it.
Got it.

1044
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:36,880
That's not mine!

1045
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,050
My friend gave it to me
for my kid.

1046
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:41,680
Give it back.
- What is the password?

1047
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:42,480
The password?

1048
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:46,553
No! That's not what you are looking
for. That's my friend's.

1049
01:11:49,850 --> 01:11:52,700
Hey, you can have the house.

1050
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:55,300
Our business is not that
long-term.

1051
01:11:55,420 --> 01:11:57,620
My car, then.
I ride a Benz.

1052
01:11:57,740 --> 01:12:01,510
A Benz, you say?
Impressive!

1053
01:12:02,170 --> 01:12:05,390
But foreign cars are cheaper when
you actually sell them.

1054
01:12:05,510 --> 01:12:07,280
But my friend gave that to me,

1055
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:11,353
for taking care of my sick kid
going overseas for treatment.

1056
01:12:12,450 --> 01:12:16,110
Okay. Sell the car, then.
Call the dealer.

1057
01:12:16,650 --> 01:12:18,330
I heard that it would
be worth 4 million.

1058
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:20,390
What are you going to
do with the 1 million?

1059
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:21,960
I will pay you later!

1060
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,850
No more waiting!
Cash right away!

1061
01:12:25,620 --> 01:12:28,080
But the kid is sick, so...

1062
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:29,730
The password?

1063
01:12:29,850 --> 01:12:31,500
My friend gave it to me.

1064
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:33,730
The password!

1065
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:35,850
Say it now or I will break
your bones!

1066
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:37,360
It hurts!
- Got it?

1067
01:12:37,480 --> 01:12:38,790
One, two!

1068
01:12:38,910 --> 01:12:41,100
1234!
- Don't make it up.

1069
01:12:41,220 --> 01:12:43,310
That's the password!

1070
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:47,510
1234?

1071
01:12:52,680 --> 01:12:56,050
You know, my life is not
as easy as it looks.

1072
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,620
I have two kids.
He has two parents as well.

1073
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:06,650
And I have spent a lot since
you became my target.

1074
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:12,560
You know, this right here,

1075
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:15,960
is a charm from Iriyakishibojin Shrine.
It treats kids' illnesses.

1076
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,698
Your kids got better, didn’t they?
This really works.

1077
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:35,740
Welcome home!

1078
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:39,400
They came to get
your car earlier.

1079
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:44,200
What's going on? Yuuko disappears,
and your car's taken away.

1080
01:13:44,540 --> 01:13:46,580
You stink of alcohol.
I can't believe you're

1081
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:48,900
having fun 'til morning
when your child's sick.

1082
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:52,250
Shut up, it doesn't have to do with you.
I quit being with Rokusuke!

1083
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:55,080
It's not your business. Go home!
- That won't do!

1084
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:58,130
I'm worried about Ken!
And the boss said,

1085
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:02,450
that he can't leave a partner from way back
alone, and is running all around...

1086
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:04,960
Oh yeah, Mr. Hiroshi!
There's an available job!

1087
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:08,990
A quiz show for parents and kids.
First place gets an international vacation!

1088
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:12,360
Thank you for your kindness.
Are you mocking a poor comedian?

1089
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,680
Don't be so sarcastic.

1090
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,910
Ken wants to go on the show.

1091
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:36,200
<i>Parent and Kid, Fun, Fun,
World Travels!</i>

1092
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:41,880
Alright, thank you. Everyone, we're
doing it for real in 10 minutes!

1093
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:45,300
Celebrities will be roaming this place in
10 minutes, so remember to smile!

1094
01:14:45,420 --> 01:14:47,500
You look a little dark,
let's get lively!

1095
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:49,764
Let's clap one more time, ready?

1096
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:54,730
Hello!
- Hey!

1097
01:14:54,850 --> 01:14:56,910
Ben, it's Mr. Shiba!
- Wow!

1098
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:59,880
Oh, I look up to you!
- Hey!

1099
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:02,050
Gahyon!

1100
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,680
Good luck, Mr. Igarashi.

1101
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,990
Oh, oh, oh!
Hiroshi, it's been a while!

1102
01:15:08,110 --> 01:15:11,530
Good thing you got invited!
I didn't know what to do, my kid,

1103
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:15,130
she wants to get the bicycle
for third place, Natsuko!

1104
01:15:15,250 --> 01:15:16,420
Your kid?
- Ken.

1105
01:15:16,540 --> 01:15:21,300
You look great!
I bet you're popular.

1106
01:15:21,420 --> 01:15:24,910
My kid's not good, she only
gets good grades.

1107
01:15:25,970 --> 01:15:28,020
Just don't lose to him.

1108
01:15:29,510 --> 01:15:31,510
Gahyon!

1109
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:38,020
Gahyon!

1110
01:15:38,140 --> 01:15:39,930
You're loud, moron.

1111
01:15:40,050 --> 01:15:43,200
Mr. Hiroshi, have a moment?
Good luck!

1112
01:15:46,110 --> 01:15:48,190
Do you know where the vacation
for first place is to?

1113
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:50,450
I don't know.
- Sydney.

1114
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:53,680
Sydney? As in the one in Australia?
- There isn't any other Sydney.

1115
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,748
Ken was excited that he'd
get to see his mom.

1116
01:15:58,570 --> 01:15:59,870
Why doesn't he say that to me?

1117
01:15:59,990 --> 01:16:02,390
It's probably
a little awkward for him to.

1118
01:16:02,510 --> 01:16:04,160
Is a mother better than
a bad father?

1119
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:08,836
It's not like that. He probably knows
that you don't have much money.

1120
01:16:25,620 --> 01:16:28,990
Good evening!
Good evening!

1121
01:16:29,110 --> 01:16:30,250
Good evening!
- Good evening!

1122
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:33,590
Welcome everyone!
It is happening once again!

1123
01:16:33,710 --> 01:16:37,880
Quiz Show, "Parent and Kid, Fun, Fun, World
Travels"! I am Yoshio Koizumi, an emcee.

1124
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,500
How are you all?
I am Hiroko Minami, an emcee.

1125
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:43,020
In this show,
as you all know very well,

1126
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,730
the parent and their child
will guess the rare,

1127
01:16:45,850 --> 01:16:49,360
scenery, plant, or animal from around
the world pictured on the screen.

1128
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,590
That is how this show works.
- Yes!

1129
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:54,390
Today is a special edition of
this show, and we invited,

1130
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:57,280
five comedians who you're
all familiar with,

1131
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,390
and their children to join us on this
show. Let's introduce them!

1132
01:17:00,510 --> 01:17:02,880
<i>The first pair is the God of Laughter,</i>

1133
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:04,360
<i>Ben Muraki and his child!</i>

1134
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:06,650
I'm Ben Muraki, famous
for my gag, "Gahyon!"

1135
01:17:06,770 --> 01:17:09,080
This is my daughter, Natsuko, thank you.
- Hello.

1136
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:11,200
<i>Good luck!
- Thank you!</i>

1137
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:15,420
<i>First question. This place is 9
and a half hours from Tokyo,</i>

1138
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:17,590
<i>and we have crossed the equator.</i>

1139
01:17:17,710 --> 01:17:20,990
<i>This is Australia's biggest city,
Sydney.</i>

1140
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:25,160
<i>People from England who immigrated
here were the first to inhabit this town,</i>

1141
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:28,710
<i>and you can see many
old buildings around.</i>

1142
01:17:29,280 --> 01:17:31,900
<i>However, there are also
many modern buildings,</i>

1143
01:17:32,020 --> 01:17:35,140
<i>being built, such as the
Sydney Tower.</i>

1144
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:37,850
<i>Now, here is the question.</i>

1145
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:42,400
<i>Please answer with the name
of this unusual building.</i>

1146
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:46,080
Wow! We have Mr. Hiroshi
answering right off the bat.

1147
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:47,450
What is the answer?

1148
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:49,220
The Diet Building.

1149
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:52,140
Aw, that's too bad!
- How unfortunate!

1150
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:55,160
Oh! The light has turned on!
Mr. Muraki, what is the answer?

1151
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,280
Opera House!

1152
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:01,820
<i>The answer is Opera House!
Good job!</i>

1153
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:02,880
<i>She's good at geography.</i>

1154
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,250
Oh really?
- That was amazing.

1155
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:06,880
We'll put one Koala here.

1156
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:08,250
Here you go.

1157
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:11,050
<i>Okay, good luck to
the other teams!</i>

1158
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:14,160
<i>Team Muraki, you are taking
the lead by storm!</i>

1159
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:17,850
<i>Team Hiroshi, maybe the dad isn't feeling
too well? You're in last place.</i>

1160
01:18:17,970 --> 01:18:19,250
<i>Good luck!</i>

1161
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:22,650
Alright, time for the next question.
It'll be about an animal.

1162
01:18:22,770 --> 01:18:24,700
Start the video!

1163
01:18:24,820 --> 01:18:26,820
<i>Time for the next question!</i>

1164
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:30,650
<i>Australia is also famous for being the
home of many unusual animals,</i>

1165
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:33,100
I'll answer first, so
you stay quiet.

1166
01:18:33,220 --> 01:18:36,790
It's okay, I'm great with animals. I had
5 in science during elementary school.

1167
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:37,990
We're not going to get a point.

1168
01:18:38,110 --> 01:18:41,560
<i>There are animals we're familiar with from
books, such as koalas and kangaroos.</i>

1169
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:45,500
<i>There are also many other animals,
such as wombats, who are,</i>

1170
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:47,700
<i>more popular than Koalas
in Australia.</i>

1171
01:18:47,820 --> 01:18:51,020
<i>Here is the question.
What is the name,</i>

1172
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:54,080
<i>of this fierce animal with
its teeth out?</i>

1173
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:57,420
Here we go! The Muraki team beats
everyone to it again! The answer?

1174
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:58,850
Tasmania devil!

1175
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:00,530
Correct!

1176
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:02,960
Alright, can we get
another Koala, please?

1177
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,560
The Koalas just seem to pile up!

1178
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:07,130
My daughter knows a lot
about animals!

1179
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:09,990
How knowledgeable!
Alright, onto the next!

1180
01:19:10,110 --> 01:19:12,400
<i>Start the video!</i>

1181
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:16,080
How tedious!
- Great job! Nice work!

1182
01:19:18,540 --> 01:19:20,190
That didn't work out, I see.
- Yeah.

1183
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:22,130
Where's Ken?
- He's getting a participation award.

1184
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:22,990
I see.

1185
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:25,130
I hear it's a Koala badge.

1186
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:27,930
How disappointing,
a participation award!

1187
01:19:28,850 --> 01:19:30,280
What are you mumbling, idiot?

1188
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:32,400
Wow, what a day!

1189
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:34,700
I have to buy her a bicycle now.

1190
01:19:34,820 --> 01:19:37,700
Natsuko says she doesn't
want the Sydney trip.

1191
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:40,990
Oh, Mr. Hiroshi, do you want it?
- No, it's fine!

1192
01:19:41,110 --> 01:19:42,730
You don't need it?
Really? Okay.

1193
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:45,370
Maybe I should invite Seiko.

1194
01:19:45,970 --> 01:19:49,330
Go get it!
For Ken's sake, go get it!

1195
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:50,590
I'm not a beggar!

1196
01:19:50,710 --> 01:19:52,900
You didn't help him, because you
didn't want to go to Sydney!

1197
01:19:53,020 --> 01:19:55,160
What are you saying?
- Then, go ask for it!

1198
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:57,480
Shut up, you knucklehead!

1199
01:19:57,850 --> 01:20:01,990
Hey! If you really want to, then take
him to Sydney or anywhere!

1200
01:20:02,110 --> 01:20:06,280
Why doesn't he ask me?
Huh? I'm his father.

1201
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:09,480
He should ask.

1202
01:20:11,110 --> 01:20:13,280
Am I that untrustworthy?

1203
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:17,540
I bet so.

1204
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:21,078
That's why he wants to
see his mom.

1205
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:25,050
Hey, call Rokusuke,

1206
01:20:25,170 --> 01:20:27,850
and tell him that he can
sell the rights.

1207
01:20:28,710 --> 01:20:31,457
I'll do some construction
work for a year.

1208
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,480
Are you sure?

1209
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:35,810
I heard that Yoshinawa
Company makes their workers

1210
01:20:35,930 --> 01:20:38,610
go around to cabarets
if they don't sell.

1211
01:20:38,770 --> 01:20:43,200
I am a performer.
Why would I take something for free?

1212
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,770
I'll perform, and earn money.

1213
01:20:47,420 --> 01:20:50,990
And then, I'll take Ken
and make him happy.

1214
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:53,370
You got it, you bastard?!

1215
01:20:55,620 --> 01:20:57,420
Oh, Mr. Hiroshi!
Can I have a signature later? -Yeah.

1216
01:20:57,540 --> 01:20:59,770
Handshake, please.
Thanks!

1217
01:21:01,570 --> 01:21:04,280
That was too bad.
Don't worry, okay?

1218
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:05,560
I'll take you with my own money.

1219
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,020
Really?
- Yes!

1220
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:11,570
Over there, there are lots of Koalas.
You can't hug them in Japan.

1221
01:21:11,940 --> 01:21:15,400
Things will go well!
- Yes!

1222
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:17,570
I'm taking the makeup off.

1223
01:21:40,940 --> 01:21:42,940
Taxi, taxi.

1224
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,280
They probably can't hear.

1225
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:52,680
Here, let me see that.

1226
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,020
It's all in English!

1227
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:56,510
What does it say?
- Huh?

1228
01:21:56,740 --> 01:21:59,790
Ah, let's see.
"The gap between,"

1229
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:02,250
"the temperatures during the
day and night is big."

1230
01:22:02,370 --> 01:22:04,240
It says that you'll
either get a sunstroke

1231
01:22:04,360 --> 01:22:06,330
during the day,
or freeze to death at night.

1232
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:08,160
My, my.
- See here? It's true.

1233
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:12,250
"The drivers of the buses and
taxis are kangaroos."

1234
01:22:13,170 --> 01:22:15,790
That's a kangaroo over there.
He's just disguised.

1235
01:22:15,910 --> 01:22:18,680
When he gets off, he'll
walk like this.

How about we rest for a bit?
Eat, and then,

1240
01:22:49,110 --> 01:22:53,050
go see the Koalas? Huh?
Or do you want to save the Koalas,

1241
01:22:53,450 --> 01:22:56,264
for tomorrow and go somewhere
else instead?

1242
01:23:04,970 --> 01:23:06,820
How about a luncheon cruise?

1243
01:23:06,940 --> 01:23:12,190
How about this, where you eat on a touring
boat while it goes around the Sydney Bay?

1244
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:14,310
I want to go on that!

1246
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:53,568
There wasn't that much to see, right?
- Yeah.

1247
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:56,970
I was too busy eating.

1248
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,480
Shall we go?
- Yes.

01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:07,220

I guess not.
I'm okay.

1252
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,340
Let's rest over there.
Okay?

1253
01:24:19,140 --> 01:24:21,800
Are you alright?
Huh? You okay?

01:24:27,910 --> 01:24:31,140
You know, Mom's workplace,

1255
01:24:31,940 --> 01:24:34,280
is somewhere around here.

1256
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:38,740
She's good at English, so she was
called over from Japan.

Oh, Miss Akino?
She's out today.

1262
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:32,082
She went to church to prepare
for her marriage.

1263
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:34,250
Marriage?

1264
01:25:34,370 --> 01:25:36,370
Yes, tomorrow is her wedding.

Mom!
- What?

1270
01:26:11,710 --> 01:26:15,900
You're the same person, but how I call
you is going to change tomorrow.

1271
01:26:16,020 --> 01:26:17,250
That's right.

1272
01:26:17,370 --> 01:26:19,130

- Yes, Mom?

01:26:27,570 --> 01:26:30,620
Very good!
Should we try it again?

1278
01:26:31,050 --> 01:26:33,050
<i>Kei.
- Yes, Mom?</i>

01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:35,400
<i>Kei.
- Yes, Mom?</i>

- Come here!

01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:41,615
Welcome home.
You made it in the nick of time.

1282
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:44,480
Yeah, we caught a lot of shrimp.

01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:46,390
The pastor is waiting.
- Huh?

1284
01:26:46,510 --> 01:26:48,330
Is rehearsal starting now?
- Yes!

1285
01:26:48,450 --> 01:26:50,800
Weddings aren't easy, are they?

1286
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,310
Would you stand next to her?

1287
01:27:29,110 --> 01:27:32,220
<i>Now, you put the rings.</i>

1288
01:27:57,910 --> 01:27:59,560
Let's go.

1289
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:04,772
We can't see her today. Let's call her
later, and maybe see her at the hotel?

1290
01:28:31,820 --> 01:28:36,940
What a mess.
I should have apologized to her, huh?

1291
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:41,080
She was probably waiting too.
You'll see, she'll come back.

1292
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:44,480
She always told me to
wait by you.

1293
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:49,170
You were seeing Mom?
- Yeah.

1294
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:51,611
Two or three times a year.
Always.

1295
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:53,530
I see.

1296
01:28:53,650 --> 01:28:56,790
A year ago, she said she was
going to Australia,

1297
01:28:56,910 --> 01:29:00,080
and came to see me.
She had given up.

1298
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:03,725
Saying, "Dad doesn't seem to
need me anymore."

1299
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:07,370
Didn't you want to go with her?

1300
01:29:07,650 --> 01:29:13,211
She said that I should stay with you 'cause
I'm a boy. That you can't be left alone.

1301
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:17,020
That's impressive.

1302
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:22,995
Anyway, you should see her later.
I'll look up her number in the phone book.

1303
01:29:23,570 --> 01:29:25,570
I won't see her.

1304
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:30,280
It's okay, I feel at peace.
She seemed so happy, didn't she?

1305
01:29:31,220 --> 01:29:36,400
You have Yuuko, but I was worried
about Mom before.

1306
01:29:38,510 --> 01:29:42,280
You, a brat, don't need to be worrying
about adults. Just go see her, okay?

1307
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,620
You need to see her.
- Why?

1308
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:48,697
Is it because I'm going to die?

1309
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:56,954
That's why I shouldn't see her.
If I do, it'll be hard for her.

1310
01:29:57,140 --> 01:29:59,040
If she knew that her
son is going to die

1311
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:02,175
because he's sick,
the day before her wedding.

1312
01:30:11,110 --> 01:30:13,110
What do I do?

1313
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,910
You were weird, and Zenpei
was weird too.

1314
01:30:18,370 --> 01:30:21,988
I thought something was going on,
and then I overheard.

1315
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:25,480
At the hospital, after the
parent-kid chorus.

1316
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,280
The people at the hospital
were whispering about it.

1317
01:30:28,400 --> 01:30:30,400
What to do...?

1318
01:30:31,250 --> 01:30:35,340
Dad, sorry for causing you
so much trouble.

1319
01:30:59,650 --> 01:31:03,650
<i>He is going to die.
He is going to die.</i>

1320
01:31:04,910 --> 01:31:06,910
<i>What do I do?</i>

1321
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:12,000
<i>What should I do for him?
I don't know.</i>

1322
01:31:13,480 --> 01:31:16,480
<i>Wait. Tell me.</i>

1323
01:31:20,250 --> 01:31:22,310
<i>I don't know.</i>

1324
01:31:23,250 --> 01:31:24,990
<i>Hey!</i>

1325
01:31:25,110 --> 01:31:28,880
<i>Say something.
Please.</i>

1326
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,400
<i>You don't know, right?</i>

1327
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:36,370
<i>You yourself are a child.
You only see yourself.</i>

1328
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:41,050
<i>You have never been an adult.</i>

1329
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:44,760
<i>A child can't do anything
for another child.</i>

1330
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,370
<i>How sad, how terrible.</i>

1331
01:32:09,480 --> 01:32:11,480
<i>You're up early.</i>

1332
01:32:12,250 --> 01:32:14,250
You're awake?
- Yes.

1333
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:17,450
The weather is great today, too!

1334
01:32:18,940 --> 01:32:23,250
How about we don't have a father son
relationship starting from today?

1335
01:32:23,370 --> 01:32:24,250
Huh?

1336
01:32:24,370 --> 01:32:27,450
How about we go as
a boy and a boy?

1337
01:32:28,370 --> 01:32:30,560
I used to be a juvenile
delinquent.

1338
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:33,450
I won't teach you how to skip
school, smoke tobacco,

1339
01:32:33,570 --> 01:32:36,680
or how to pick up a woman.

1340
01:32:41,420 --> 01:32:45,050
Well, when you become a
high school student,

1341
01:32:45,740 --> 01:32:48,480
we'll probably be great friends.

1342
01:32:54,370 --> 01:32:57,160
Anyway, we're throwing
out the father idea.

1343
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:58,760
Boy to boy from now.

1344
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,880
Okay?
- Okay!

1345
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:17,310
<i>St. Mary's Cathedral</i>

1346
01:34:04,970 --> 01:34:09,100
<i>Argyle Prison</i>

1347
01:34:09,220 --> 01:34:12,820
<i>But now, it is a shopping center.</i>

1348
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:52,850
<i>Kings Cross Road</i>

1349
01:34:52,970 --> 01:34:55,300
<i>Wallaby</i>

1350
01:34:55,420 --> 01:34:58,220
<i>Koala</i>

1351
01:35:01,650 --> 01:35:04,080
<i>Wombat</i>

1352
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:10,600
<i>White-bellied Sea Eagle</i>

1353
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:14,200
<i>Short-beaked Echidna</i>

1354
01:35:14,370 --> 01:35:19,000
<i>Tasmanian Devil</i>

1355
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:31,665
<i>Featherdale Wildlife Park. People can play
with animals, such as wallaby's and koalas.</i>

1356
01:35:39,510 --> 01:35:43,450
<i>Koalas feel uneasy unless they
are hugging onto something.</i>

1357
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:57,980
<i>Because they only eat
southern blue gum,</i>

1358
01:35:58,100 --> 01:36:01,670
<i>Koalas' urine has the fragrance
of southern blue gum.</i>

1359
01:36:17,820 --> 01:36:21,970
Hey, if you want to, you're allowed
to stay here forever.

1360
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:25,220
We could even go see
all of Australia.

1361
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:27,450
I'll go home.

1362
01:36:28,050 --> 01:36:30,250
If I get more sick here,
it'll be troublesome

1363
01:36:30,370 --> 01:36:33,988
for you, and if Mom finds out,
that'll be hard for her.

1364
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:37,400
I already played hard,
so I'm fine.

1365
01:36:38,200 --> 01:36:42,000
It was really fun.
Thanks, Dad.

1366
01:36:47,820 --> 01:36:51,160
Hey, this Koala was fun,
wasn't it?

1367
01:36:51,280 --> 01:36:54,220
Hugging onto everything
like this, huh?

1368
01:36:54,940 --> 01:36:56,940
It's cute, isn't it?

1369
01:37:00,170 --> 01:37:02,170
You don't hug, do you?

1370
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:08,800
There really isn't anyone
to hug, is there?

1371
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:15,280
No mom, and I'm not
very useful either.

1372
01:37:17,570 --> 01:37:21,680
But from now on, you can
hug me, alright?

1373
01:38:45,570 --> 01:38:47,500
What's wrong, huh?

1374
01:38:47,620 --> 01:38:50,050
Hey, are you alright?
Huh?

1375
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:53,140
My ears are strange.

1376
01:38:53,510 --> 01:38:55,510
Try swallowing your spit.

1377
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,360
My ears are ringing.

1378
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:06,280
That's weird, the plane's altitude
hasn't changed.

1379
01:39:07,510 --> 01:39:10,600
It's shaking, it's shaking!

1380
01:39:10,910 --> 01:39:13,310
You're probably just dizzy.

1381
01:39:15,910 --> 01:39:19,850
It's four now. We can go to the
doctor in two hours, alright?

1382
01:39:19,970 --> 01:39:21,330
It's spinning!

1383
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:23,850
It's spinning around and around!

1384
01:39:25,550 --> 01:39:26,450
Wait a bit.

1385
01:39:26,570 --> 01:39:29,200
Don't move, okay?

1386
01:39:43,800 --> 01:39:47,650
We are sorry to disturb you during your
sleep, but we have an announcement.

1387
01:39:47,770 --> 01:39:50,420
There is a person with a sudden
illness on this plane.

1388
01:39:50,540 --> 01:39:54,280
<i>If there is anyone that is
a doctor, or a nurse,</i>

1389
01:39:54,400 --> 01:39:56,760
<i>please let a flight attendant
know immediately.</i>

1390
01:39:56,880 --> 01:40:01,250
<i>May I have your attention, please?
There is a sick passenger on board.</i>

1391
01:40:01,370 --> 01:40:04,280
<i>And if there is a doctor or
a nurse on this flight...</i>

1392
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:05,650
<i>Is it hurting?
- ...please contact...</i>

1393
01:40:05,770 --> 01:40:08,718
<i>...one of our cabinet attendants
immediately.</i>

1394
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:13,310
We have a doctor here.

1395
01:40:14,000 --> 01:40:17,650
I heard most of it.
Your child, right?

1396
01:40:31,450 --> 01:40:35,620
He's experiencing renewed brain pressure.
There isn't anything we can do here.

1397
01:40:35,740 --> 01:40:38,250
Have Narita prepare an emergency
operation.

1398
01:40:38,370 --> 01:40:40,480
Call a brain surgeon.
- Alright.

1399
01:40:40,600 --> 01:40:43,400
And make sure to
keep him rested.

1400
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:48,710
Dad, am I going to die?

1401
01:40:52,220 --> 01:40:54,220
I'm going to die, aren't I?

1402
01:40:54,680 --> 01:40:58,420
I'm scared.
You go alone when you die, right?

1403
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:01,420
<i>I'm scared.
I'm scared, dad!</i>

1404
01:41:02,650 --> 01:41:05,170
Hug me, hold on to your dad.

1405
01:41:14,170 --> 01:41:17,020
Hold on.
You're doing great.

1406
01:41:17,740 --> 01:41:20,820
I won't forgive you if you've finally
hugged me and this is the last time!

1407
01:41:20,940 --> 01:41:22,190
Ken!

1408
01:41:22,310 --> 01:41:24,310
Ken...

1409
01:41:25,140 --> 01:41:28,850
Doctor, he fell asleep.

1410
01:41:28,970 --> 01:41:33,660
That's not good, right? He's going
to die if he falls asleep, isn't he?

1411
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:38,110
Ken, you can do it!
Come on, you idiot!

1412
01:41:39,140 --> 01:41:41,140
Ken!

1413
01:41:41,420 --> 01:41:43,540
Don't fall asleep! Ken!

1414
01:41:46,020 --> 01:41:48,020
Hey, Ken!

1415
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:51,130
Worrying about other people
instead of yourself.

1416
01:41:51,250 --> 01:41:54,450
Are you going to give up
just like that? Hey!

1417
01:41:55,540 --> 01:41:58,450
Ken, wake up, wake up!

1418
01:41:58,850 --> 01:42:00,530
Wake up!

1419
01:42:00,650 --> 01:42:04,130
You're going to do the parent-kid
chorus again, right?

1420
01:42:04,250 --> 01:42:07,800
You can conduct, and I'll sing!
Okay?

1421
01:42:08,250 --> 01:42:11,340
Hey, Ken!

1422
01:42:12,020 --> 01:42:15,110
Please conduct, you can do it!

1423
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:17,970
I memorized the song!

1424
01:42:19,480 --> 01:42:23,620
There was a part that goes,
green, green, right?

1425
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:29,250
Green, green, blue sky.
Come on! Hey!

1426
01:42:32,940 --> 01:42:36,140
Green, green, the birds,

1427
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:40,600
in the blue sky.
Hey! Ken!

1428
01:42:44,140 --> 01:42:48,250
Ken! Please conduct.
Okay?

1429
01:42:48,820 --> 01:42:50,820
Come on.

1430
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:04,020
<i>I can't believe this.
How can I?</i>

1431
01:43:04,540 --> 01:43:08,540
<i>This is too much, too harsh!</i>

1432
01:43:18,850 --> 01:43:22,650
Congratulations! I am coming in!
Yoshinaga Company is pleased!

1433
01:43:22,770 --> 01:43:25,080
Because it's a big deal!

1434
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:29,540
We are doing seven times
better than others!

1435
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:32,850
We got a lot of money, anyway.

1436
01:43:33,020 --> 01:43:36,900
Everything is moving toward a good
direction! That one case was solved,

1437
01:43:37,020 --> 01:43:39,570
and they just felt empathy
for you.

1438
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:41,800
It's almost time.

1439
01:43:43,020 --> 01:43:45,020
Ah, Hiroshi.

1440
01:43:45,510 --> 01:43:49,880
The company is wanting a
ceremony for your loss.

1441
01:43:50,510 --> 01:43:53,600
And so, by next week,
you need to...

1442
01:43:55,570 --> 01:44:00,250
Don't mistake yourself as anything great.
You're a tragedy of a father.

1443
01:44:00,370 --> 01:44:05,280
You need to humble yourself.
You're trash, you need to sell it!

1444
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:14,540
Is that what it is?
